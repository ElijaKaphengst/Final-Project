# Final-Project - 6th Semester Project
 
The Code of my final project, 6th Semester (Spring 2019 - Sommer 2020), from my Game-Designer education.

It has tools for creating an NPC path and a random area in wich the NPC can walk.
It also has an Dialogue-System with a TreeView to create new Dialogues.
